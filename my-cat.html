    <h1>My cat Bela and her daily routines</h1>

    <h2>First some info about her</h2>
    <p>She was found in the garage by my father when he parked his car one cold
      November day. She is probably 4-5 months old, determined by how small
      she initially was and how her milky teeth started to fall off recently.
      She is a girl(obviously).</p>
