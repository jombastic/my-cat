    <h1>My cat Bela and her daily routines</h1>

    <h2>First some info about her</h2>
    <p>She was found in the garage by my father when he parked his car one cold
      November day. She is probably 4-5 months old, determined by how small
      she initially was and how her milky teeth started to fall off recently.
      She is a girl(obviously).</p>

    <h3>And now here is what my cat likes to do throughout the day.</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Eating</li>
      <li>Sleeping</li>
      <li>Running around</li>
      <li>Playing with anything that seems playable</li>
      <li>More eating</li>
      <li>More sleaping</li>
      <li>Sitting on the freezer and staring through the window<li>
    </ul>
  </body>
