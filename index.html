    <h1 class="cat">My cat <em>Bela</em> and her daily routines</h1>

    <h2 class="cat">First some info about her</h2>
    <p class="cat">She was found in the garage by my <strong>father</strong> when he parked his car one cold
      <em>November</em> day. She is probably <strong>4-5 months</strong> old, determined by how small
      she initially was and how her milky teeth started to fall off recently.
      She is a girl (obviously).</p>

    <h3 class="cat">And now here is what my cat likes to do throughout the day:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Eating</li>
      <li>Sleeping</li>
      <li>Running around</li>
      <li>Playing with anything that seems playable</li>
      <li>More eating</li>
      <li>More sleaping</li>
      <li>Sitting on the freezer and staring through the window</li>
    </ul>
    <p>My cat also likes to bother my <em>family</em> when she's bored</p>

    <h3 class="cat">This are some of her favorite toys:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>The Christmas tree

          Her ball
        </a>
      </li>
      <li>My sister</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="cat">Well... that's it. If I think of anything else, I'll let you know</p>
